=> In middleware we add functions that are hooked into this
funnel through which the request goes and we either have
next to reach the next middleware or send a response
We travel from middleware to middleware from top to bottom
using next

=> urlencoded is a like other callback function.It uses next at the end

=>One should see the order in which middlewares will be
executed.

=> To avoid the order issue we are running this block of code


=> Filtering mechanism allows us to put a common starting 
segment for our path which all routes in a given file use to 
outsource that into this app.js file so that we don't have to repeat
it for all routes

=> .. will also work instead of ../

=> mainModule is deprecated. Hence we used require.main.filename.
